# Zaky Rizky Akbar - Aspiring Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer

## Hi there 👋

✨ About Me

I'm Zaky Rizky Akbar, an aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with solid training in Hacktiv8’s Data Science program. I’m deeply curious about how data shapes decision-making and enjoy building models that are both technically sound and practically useful.

My learning journey has been hands-on and project-driven, focused on building regression and classification models, as well as exploring unsupervised learning techniques like clustering. Recently, I’ve been diving into deep learning, working on projects involving computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). I approach each project not just as a technical challenge, but as a way to develop meaningful solutions and sharpen my understanding of how data can be applied effectively.
